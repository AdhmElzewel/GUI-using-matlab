## Introduction:-
 Projectile motion is the motion of an object in two dimensions. This 
means that if an object moves in both the horizontal and vertical 
directions at the same time, it is said to be exhibiting a projectile motion. 
In simple words, if an object tends to follow a curved or parabolic path 
of motion, projectile motion is said to be existing.
 There are many practical applications based on perfect knowledge 
of projectile motion such as :
 When a cannonball is fired from a cannon, it does not move along a straight 
line, instead, it follows a curved path. This is because the firing is done at an 
angle that causes the ball to move vertically and horizontally at the same 
time. Hence, the projectile motion is said to be existing.
 In a circus, human cannon-balls are projectiles. It would be difficult to know 
where to place a safety net if we did not know the equations that reflect a 
projectile’s motion and position.
 Fireworks and the motion of any ball in sports.
And the importance of describing the body in some applications for 
safety and security, as in calculating the maximum distance that a 
volcano shell can reach if it is near residential places, as well as for 
good design in some projects that depend on projectile motion , such 
as rockets in space and satellite 
 Therefore, we decided to design a program that helps the user in 
solving equations that describe the movement of the projectile body 
based on some initial values of its movement that will be entered by the 
user, and this is what will be identified in the following details.

## GRAFICAL USER INTERFACE
 First, the design must refer to the use of the program, which is designed 
to make it easier for any user to understand its contents
 Secondly, most of the user's choices are provided in terms of input and 
output units
 And to make it easier for the user, we tried to make the program 
interface allow him all the options as follows:

The program will output the result of the operations that it has 
performed, and to help the user find and understand it in a simple way, 
we have put it in a group titled Outputs.
The maximum distance traveled by the body from 
the point of ejection to the point of landing is known as the Range
7 | P a g e
The maximum height reached by the 
projectile body during its movement
The coordinates of a point on the x-axis that 
intersects the maximum height reached by the projectile.
The horizontal component of the velocity in the x￾direction.
The vertical component of the velocity in the y￾direction.
The time it takes for a body to fall after it has lost all of 
its energy with which it was ejected

## THEORIES
 Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into 
the air, subject to only the acceleration of gravity. The object is called a 
projectile, and its path is called its trajectory.
The primary force acting on a projectile is gravity. This doesn’t 
necessarily mean that other forces do not act on it, just that their effect is 
minimal compared to gravity.
 In projectile motion, the horizontal motion and the vertical motion are 
independent of each other; that is, neither motion affects the other. Since 
the gravitational force pulls downward, gravity will only affect the 
vertical component of the velocity.
